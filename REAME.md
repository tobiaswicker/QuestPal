# QuestPal

QuestPal is a [Telegram](https://telegram.org) bot that lets users hunt quests in Pok√©mon Go. QuestPal is designed to 
work with quests made available by [Map'A'Droid](https://github.com/Map-A-Droid/MAD/).  

## Features & Usage
- At first the user has to select an area and the quests they like to hunt. This has to be done just once.
- The user can then start the hunt and QuestPal shows the quest that is closest in terms of a straight line / as the 
crow flies to the users location.
- Quests can be marked as `Collected` which sets the user location to the location of the quest and looks for other 
quests nearby.
- Quests can also be deferred by pressing `Later` or put on an `Ignored` list. Both choices won't change the user 
location from which to look for new quests.
